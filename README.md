# HelpingHand

You’re ready to go hillwalking, but you have a blister on your foot and you’ve no plaster to put on it. People nearby probably have plasters with them and would be happy to share with you. You’re in a hotel room with your daughter; she has a high fever but you’ve no paracetamol in your luggage. Many people in the hotel have paracetamol, but who to ask? You’ve moved house. You have a bottle of wine to celebrate, but no corkscrew. Your car won’t start; you need a set of jump leads. Someone nearby must have a set, but who to ask? 


Here’s where the Helping Hand app comes to your rescue. Simply type in your request and others in the Helping Hand community who are nearby will see your request and be able to come to your aid. When someone helps you out, you each get a chance to provide a review for the other and everyone in the community can see everyone’s rating. Helping Hand helps you to get that little bit of help when you need it and gives you a chance to help others out as well.
